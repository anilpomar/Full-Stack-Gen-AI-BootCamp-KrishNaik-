# Complex Document for RAG Parsing Tests

Synthetic 15-page PDF with paragraphs, simple and complex tables, diagrams, scanned-form style image, metadata examples, and production RAG edge cases.

## Story Line

Three client teams - Arka Finance, BlueLeaf Retail, and CityRide Mobility - are migrating contracts, policies, support records, and operational reports into a single RAG platform. Each team has different document types, access rules, and parsing challenges. The RAG system must answer questions with citations while ensuring that one client never sees another clients data.

This PDF is intentionally designed to test document loaders, PDF parsers, OCR workflows, table extraction, chunking strategies, metadata preservation, and source citation quality.

<mark>Key statement: RAG does not train the model. RAG gives the model the right context before answering.</mark>

# 1. Business Scenario

The platform team is building a document intelligence layer for contract operations. Legal users need answers such as: Which contracts renew automatically? Which agreements have a 60-day termination notice? Which documents mention data residency in India? These questions require retrieval across multiple document types and sometimes across multiple related documents of a single client.

Support teams also want answers from SOPs, markdown runbooks, HTML exports, chat transcripts, and CSV logs. A single parser is not enough because the corpus contains born-digital PDFs, scanned forms, HTML, markdown, and spreadsheet-like tables.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Client</th>
        <th>Main document family</th>
        <th>Risk</th>
        <th>Primary users</th>
        <th>Typical question</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

        <td>BlueLeaf Retail</td>
<td>MSA, pricing, support SLA</td>

# 2. Raw Data Inventory

The ingestion team receives files from multiple sources. Some files are clean and digital; others contain scanned pages, rotated tables, missing metadata, embedded images, or formula-generated values. The inventory below intentionally includes different formats and extraction expectations.

  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Asset ID</th>
        <th>Client</th>

**Parsing difficulty increases when a document combines multiple layouts: paragraph text, tables, images, and notes. Good parsers preserve structure; weak parsers flatten everything into a noisy text stream.**

# 3. Contract Excerpt: Dense Legal Text

Clause 7.2 - Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential materials, but in no event less than reasonable care. Confidential Information includes technical documents, pricing schedules, user lists, API keys, operational procedures, security reports, incident response notes, product roadmaps, and any derived analysis prepared by the Receiving Party.

Clause 7.3 - Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly available without breach, independently developed without reference to the Disclosing Party material, received lawfully from a third party, or approved for release in writing. The burden of proving an exclusion remains with the Receiving Party.

Clause 9.1 - Data Residency. If the Statement of Work identifies a specific processing region, the service provider shall process production records only within that region unless the client approves a transfer in writing. Disaster recovery replicas may be stored in a secondary region if encryption at rest and access logging are enabled.

Clause 11.4 - Termination Assistance. Upon termination, the provider shall make client data available for export for a period of thirty days. After the export period, the provider may delete production data according to the deletion schedule unless a legal hold applies.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Clause</th>
        <th>Short name</th>
        <th>Owner</th>
        <th>Trigger</th>
        <th>Required action</th>
        <th>Citation hint</th>

<td>Termination assistance</td>
<td>Service Provider</td>
<td>Agreement termination</td>
<td>Provide export window for 30 days</td>
<td>Page 4, clause 11.4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Parser note: clause numbering is important. Chunking should not remove or split clause identifiers because users often ask questions using clause numbers.**

# 4. Simple Table: Policy Rules

The following table is intentionally simple. It should be correctly extracted by most PDF table parsers. It tests basic row and column detection, short text values, and numeric values.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Policy Area</th>
        <th>Rule</th>
        <th>Owner</th>
        <th>Review Cycle</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Refunds</td>
<td>Refund requests must be raised within 7 days of purchase.</td>
<td>Customer Support</td>
<td>Quarterly</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Data Export</td>
<td>Client admins can request export in CSV or JSON format.</td>
<td>Platform Ops</td>
<td>Monthly</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Access Review</td>
<td>Privileged access must be reviewed every 30 days.</td>
<td>Security</td>
<td>Monthly</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Incident Response</td>
<td>Critical incidents require acknowledgement within 30 minutes.</td>
<td>SRE</td>
<td>After each incident</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Vendor Review</td>
<td>High-risk vendors require annual risk assessment.</td>
<td>Procurement</td>
<td>Annual</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Narrative Around the Table

This table appears between paragraphs, which is common in enterprise documents. A good parser should preserve the paragraph before the table, the table content, and the paragraph after the table in the correct reading order.

For RAG systems, simple tables are often converted into row-wise text chunks such as: Policy Area: Refunds; Rule: Refund requests must be raised within 7 days; Owner: Customer Support.

# 5. Complex Table: SLA, Escalation, and Credits

This table uses long cells and operational footnotes. It is designed to test whether the parser can retain header hierarchy and map values to the correct columns.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Service Category</th>
        <th>Severity</th>
        <th>Response Target</th>
        <th>Resolution Target</th>
        <th>Service Credit</th>
        <th>Evidence Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>API Availability</td>
<td>P1 - complete outage</td>
<td>15 minutes</td>
<td>4 hours</td>
<td>10 percent monthly fee credit</td>
<td>Monitoring logs and incident ticket</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>API Availability</td>
<td>P2 - degraded performance</td>
<td>30 minutes</td>
<td>8 hours</td>
<td>5 percent monthly fee credit</td>
<td>Latency dashboard and affected endpoint list</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Data Pipeline</td>
<td>P1 - ingestion stopped</td>
<td>20 minutes</td>
<td>6 hours</td>
<td>8 percent pipeline fee credit</td>
<td>Queue depth, failed job IDs, replay report</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Data Pipeline</td>
<td>P3 - delayed batch</td>
<td>4 hours</td>
<td>Next business day</td>
<td>No automatic credit</td>
<td>Batch ID and SLA exception note</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Support</td>
<td>P2 - urgent support</td>
<td>1 hour</td>
<td>1 business day</td>
<td>2 percent support fee credit</td>
<td>Support ticket with timestamps</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Footnote A: Service credits are not cumulative across the same service category for the same calendar month. Footnote B: Credits do not apply when delay is caused by client-side network restrictions, missing credentials, or force majeure events.

Parser note: table footnotes should remain attached to the table. If the footnote is separated, an answer about credits may become incomplete or misleading.

# 6. Image: RAG Architecture Diagram

The diagram below represents the ingestion and retrieval flow. Some PDF parsers ignore images completely, while others extract image metadata but not the text inside the image. For production use, image content may require OCR or multimodal extraction.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Ingestion
        A["**Raw Files**PDF / DOCX / HTML"] --> B["**Parser**Text + Tables"]
        B --> C["**Chunks**Sections + Metadata"]
        C --> D["**Vector DB**Embeddings"]
    end

    subgraph Retrieval
        E["**User Query**question"] --> B
        D --> F["**Retriever**top-k chunks"]
        F --> G["**LLM**grounded answer"]
    end

# 7. Markdown Runbook Excerpt

Markdown files are often easier to parse because headings and code blocks are explicit. However, when markdown is exported to PDF, the structure may become visual rather than semantic.

```markdown
# Runbook: Contract Ingestion Failure

## Symptoms
- Upload status remains `processing` for more than 30 minutes.
- Worker logs show repeated timeout errors.
- Vector count does not increase for the affected document.

## Recovery Steps
1. Confirm the object exists in document storage.
2. Re-run parser with `safe_mode=True`.
3. Rebuild chunks with the previous chunking configuration.
4. Compare chunk count with the last successful ingestion.
5. Trigger re-embedding only for changed chunks.
```

A good parser should preserve code block boundaries and avoid mixing numbered steps with surrounding prose. In RAG, runbooks are useful because users often ask operational questions that require exact steps.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Runbook field</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Parsing expectation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Title</td>
<td>Contract Ingestion Failure</td>
<td>Should become section title metadata</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Symptoms</td>
<td>Five bullet items</td>
<td>Should remain as list or separate lines</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Recovery Steps</td>
<td>Numbered sequence</td>
<td>Order must be preserved</td>

# 8. Scanned Form and OCR Challenge

This page contains a scanned-form style image. Text inside the form is not normal selectable PDF text. A simple text parser may miss it entirely. OCR-based systems should extract labels, values, and checkboxes from the image.

## CONTRACT INTAKE FORM

**Client Name**: BlueLeaf Retail Pvt Ltd
**Contract ID**: BLR-MSA-2026-019
**Effective Date**: 01 Apr 2026
**Renewal Type**: Auto renewal with 60 day notice
**Data Region**: India - South
**Reviewer**: K. Mehta
[x] Approved for ingestion after PII masking

Caption: The form includes fields such as Client Name, Contract ID, Effective Date, Renewal Type, Data Region, Reviewer, and a checkbox approval statement.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Expected OCR value</th>
        <th>Validation rule</th>
    </tr>

<td>Pattern: client-code + type + year + sequence</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Effective Date</td>
<td>01 Apr 2026</td>
<td>Date parser should normalize to ISO format</td>

<td>Checked</td>
<td>Boolean extraction required</td>

# 9. Multiple Documents for One Client

BlueLeaf Retail has five related contract documents. If these documents are indexed independently without relationship metadata, the retriever may miss cross-document context. The platform uses a `contract_group_id` to connect related documents.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>document_id</th>
        <th>document_type</th>
        <th>contract_group_id</th>
        <th>effective_date</th>
        <th>relationship</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>BLR-MSA-001</td>
<td>Master Service<br/>Agreement</td>
<td>BLR-ACME-2026</td>
<td>2026-04-01</td>
<td>Base commercial agreement</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>BLR-NDA-002</td>
<td>NDA</td>
<td>BLR-ACME-2026</td>
<td>2026-04-01</td>
<td>Confidentiality terms</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>BLR-SOW-003</td>
<td>Statement of Work</td>
<td>BLR-ACME-2026</td>
<td>2026-04-15</td>
<td>Project scope and deliverables</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>BLR-PRICE-004</td>
<td>Pricing Amendment</td>
<td>BLR-ACME-2026</td>
<td>2026-05-01</td>
<td>Updated pricing and discount tiers</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>BLR-SLA-005</td>
<td>Support SLA</td>
<td>BLR-ACME-2026</td>
<td>2026-05-10</td>
<td>Support response and credits</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Example question: What does the BlueLeaf agreement say about termination assistance and pricing changes? A good retriever may need chunks from the MSA and the Pricing Amendment together.

<mark>Relationship metadata allows retrieval across related documents without mixing unrelated client data.</mark>

# 10. Multi-tenant Retrieval and Access Control

In a multi-tenant RAG system, each document, chunk, embedding, and retrieval request should be associated with a tenant identifier. Client isolation should happen before the LLM receives any context.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Layer</th>
        <th>Control</th>
        <th>Failure mode if missing</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Authentication</td>
<td>Identify user and organization</td>
<td>Unknown user may access application</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Authorization</td>
<td>Map user to client_id and role</td>
<td>User may retrieve another clients documents</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Vector retrieval</td>
<td>Filter by client_id or namespace</td>
<td>Retriever may return unauthorized chunks</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Prompt construction</td>
<td>Send only allowed context</td>
<td>LLM may see sensitive data</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Audit logging</td>
<td>Record query, source chunks, user_id</td>
<td>No traceability during incident review</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Correct flow: authenticate user, get client_id from backend, retrieve only matching chunks, build prompt with authorized context, return answer with citations.**

Wrong flow: retrieve from all clients and tell the model to ignore unauthorized content. This is unsafe because the LLM should not be used as the access-control boundary.

# 11. Analytics Image: Retention Heatmap

The heatmap below simulates viewership retention by time slot. A parser that ignores chart images will miss useful business context. OCR can extract axis labels and numbers, but chart understanding may require a vision model.

# 12. Evaluation Dataset

A RAG system should be evaluated separately for retrieval quality and answer quality. This page includes a miniature evaluation set with expected source references. It is useful for testing whether citations point to the correct section.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Test ID</th>
        <th>Question</th>
        <th>Expected source</th>
        <th>Expected answer element</th>
        <th>Failure signal</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Q-001</td>
<td>What is the refund window?</td>
<td>Policy Rules table</td>
<td>7 days</td>
<td>Answer says 30 days</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Q-002</td>
<td>Which clause covers data residency?</td>
<td>Clause 9.1</td>
<td>Approved processing region</td>
<td>No clause citation</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Q-003</td>
<td>What is P1 API response target?</td>
<td>SLA table</td>
<td>15 minutes</td>
<td>Wrong severity row</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Q-004</td>
<td>Which documents belong to BLR-ACME-2026?</td>
<td>Relationship table</td>
<td>Five related documents</td>
<td>Only one document returned</td>

<tr>
        <td>Q-005</td>
<td>Who owns access review?</td>
<td>Policy Rules table</td>
<td>Security</td>
<td>Owner missing</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Evaluation should include adversarial questions, unrelated questions, and questions that require multi-hop retrieval across related documents.
